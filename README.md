## Download

* **MacOS:**
    * [Mac Intel](https://github.com/6174/comflowyspace/releases/download/v0.2.0-alpha/comflowy-0.2.0-alpha.dmg) (Note that if you have an Intel Macbook, make sure it has AMD graphics before installing, otherwise it won't work!)
    * [Mac M](https://github.com/6174/comflowyspace/releases/download/v0.2.0-alpha/comflowy-0.2.0-alpha-arm64.dmg)  
* **[Windows](https://github.com/6174/comflowyspace/releases/download/v0.2.0-alpha/comflowy-0.2.0-alpha.zip)**

## Cloud Version
If your computer's performance isn't sufficient for the local version, you can also try our [cloud version](https://www.comflowy.com).

The differences between cloud version and the local open-source version are:
1) It's pre-installed with various common extensions, so you don't have to worry about environment conflicts.
2) You can directly choose and use models from Civitai, eliminating the need to download them to your local machine.
3) Cloud GPU operation enables the execution of more complex workflows.
