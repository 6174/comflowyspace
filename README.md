# Comfyspace 

Comfyspace is an open-source AI imagery and video generation tool committed to providing a better, 
interactive experience than the standard webui and comfyui.Many people are hesitant to learn about 
or participate in the wave of AI generation simply because the tools required are often too complex.  
This is a problem that we're set on solving. We believe that it is crucial to develop an AI imagery 
and video generation tool that is both easier to use and more useful - Comfyspace

The goal of Comfyspace is to make ComfyUI & Stable Diffusion accessible to all. 
From downloading and installing to plug-in management, 
workflow templates, and process editing, every step is well designed.
